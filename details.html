        <p> Uncle Scary's channel  mainly consists of 2 types of videos</p>
        <h1>"""Normal""" videos</h1>
        <p>those video are usually either an introduction, an intermission or closing notes for very old and niche horror films, classics such as </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>BEAST FROM YUCCA FLATS</p></li>
          <li><p>Maneater Form Hydra</p></li>
          <li><p>Night of the ghouls</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p> the video's audio and video quality varies between videos, some are seemly recorded on VHS, hinting to the fact that most of video are old,possibly very very old<br>
        most of video in the category are reuploaded on Uncle Scary's channels about 4-5 times, and it appears that the Youtube algortim doesn't like those videos because they have no views  </p>
      </br>
      <h1>Abnormal videos</h1>
      <p>those type videos are, unlike the normal ones, not as thoroughly reuploaded and in opinion, hold more knowledge then it seems,the most peculiar vidoe I found would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKVCBPosJ48&t=2s">OPERATION WITCHFORCE</a>, a trully bizarre video where Uncle Scary make a video on himself, but not in character, audio is hard to understand and the video look like shit (Further research needed)</p>
    </br>
    <h1>Removal of content</h1>
    <p>One of the reasons to why covering this topic is so hard, it's becuse Uncle Scary regularly deletes vidoes (and sometimes entire channels),for long periods of timem,I cant seem to find why he does it</p>
    <h1><a href="https://saturdaynightmares.tripod.com"> Scary 3.0</a></h1>
    <p>This ancient website is big source to this ongoing investigation,now we know about such things as Uncle Scary's idol,David "The Rock" Nelson (a notoriously bad horror movie maker and boxer), and his great knowledge about allegedly hounted castle</p>
    <p>We also get the first know date that Uncle Scary has been operating, 1996!(god I wasn't even born then), Uncle Scary had a show that would recreate scenes form horror movies and do seances, it is still unknow when he started to make videos on Youtube</p>
