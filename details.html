      <h1>Uncle Scary Details</h1>

      <p>This section will delve deeper into the mysteries surrounding Uncle Scary. We'll explore topics like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Channel history and upload patterns</p></li>
        <li><p>Analysis of Uncle Scary's site</p></li>
        <li><p>The list of links to Uncle Scary stuff</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Uncle Scary's channel mainly consists of 2 types of videos:</p>

      <h1>"Normal" Videos</h1>
      <p>These videos are usually either an introduction, an intermission, or closing notes for very old and niche horror films, classics such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>BEAST FROM YUCCA FLATS</p></li>
        <li><p>Maneater From Hydra</p></li> <li><p>Night of the Ghouls</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The video's audio and video quality vary between videos. Some are seemingly recorded on VHS, hinting at the fact that most of the videos are old, possibly very old.</p><br>
      <p>Most videos in this category are reuploaded on Uncle Scary's channels about 4-5 times. It appears that the Youtube algorithm doesn't like those videos because they have no views.</p><br>

      <h1>Abnormal Videos</h1>
      <p>These types of videos, unlike the normal ones, are not as thoroughly reuploaded and, in my opinion, hold more knowledge than it seems. The most peculiar video I found would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKVCBPosJ48&t=2s">OPERATION WITCHFORCE</a>, a truly bizarre video where Uncle Scary makes a video about himself, but not in character. The audio is hard to understand and the video looks like garbage (further research needed).</p><br>

      <h1>Removal of Content</h1>
      <p>One of the reasons why covering this topic is so hard is because Uncle Scary regularly deletes videos (and sometimes entire channels) for long periods of time. I can't seem to find why he does it.</p>

      <h1><a href="https://saturdaynightmares.tripod.com">Scary 3.0</a></h1>
      <p>This ancient website is a big source for this ongoing investigation. Now we know about such things as Uncle Scary's idol, David "The Rock" Nelson (a notoriously bad horror movie maker and boxer), and his great knowledge about an allegedly haunted castle.</p>
      <p>We also get the first known date that Uncle Scary has been operating: 1996! (God, I wasn't even born then). Uncle Scary had a show that would recreate scenes from horror movies and do seances. It is still unknown when he started making videos on Youtube.</p>
