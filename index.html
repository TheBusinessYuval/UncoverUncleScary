        <h1>Who is Uncle Scary?</h1>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>For over a 3 years now the Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@unclescarymania">Uncle Scary</a> Has been making complanitary video for old and obscure horror films</a></p><br />
          <p>The videos feature Uncle Scary consists of presenting, hosting intermissions, or delivering closing remarks for a particular movie in a simple and corny way, 
            however the due to Uncle Scary's heavy accent and bad aduio quality it is ususly hard to make out what is been said, 
          </p><br />
          <p>
          But the most peculiar thing about the Uncle Scary Youtube channel is the amount of videos it has, a channel like this, how many video do you think it has? 
          </p>
          <p>10? 20? 50?  perhaps 100?</p><br />
          <p>would you belive me if I said over 14,000 videos?</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>This is a warning to those who meet up with me, you are going to leave the comfort of the light and set in to the world of the supernatural </p>
            <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNXpGKTA8Bs&t=42s">Uncle Scary my first video 2 </a> </p>
          </blockquote>

        <h1>Other Oddities</h1>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p> Uncle Scary's channel also includes more strange things, for example his saved playlist, 
            he has over 23 different playlist each filled with hundreds of horror movies,all the playlists are organized for favorite to 23th' favorite <br />
          He is also subscribed to ten of hundreds of other Youtube channels all some how related to horror films or media</p><br />
 
          <p>While a large amout of the video on the channel follow the format I talked about before there are unique videos, such as 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKVCBPosJ48&t=2s">OPERATION WITCHFORCE</a>
            , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7uAvAtyNY4">Tor Johnson walking</a>
            and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mVjHPW5uj4">Scary Skull man</a><br />
           While those videos might meen more, I can't seem to understand them (especially OPERATION WITCHFORCE)   
          </p> <br />

        </div>
        
        <h1> Another One!</h1>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>Another abnormalty about the channel is the reuse of content, both on the "main channel" and "secondary channels" (
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@terrortheatremania2">Uncle Scary "2" </a>, 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@terrortheatremania3">Uncle Scary 3 </a>) </p> <br />
          <p>the reuploading of content on the channels is so excessive that most videos are reuploaded about 3 time on a single channel
            ,but the same time many of the content on the channel are regularly deleted, and at times the whole of the channel gets taken down, due to that it is possible that this channel has been operting (in some form) for much longer then writen on Youtube </p>
