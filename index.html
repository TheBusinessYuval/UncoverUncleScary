        <h1>Who is Uncle Scary?</h1>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>For over 3 years now, the Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@unclescarymania">Uncle Scary</a> has been making complimentary videos for old and obscure horror films.</p><br />
          <p>The videos consist of presenting or delivering closing remarks for a particular movie in a simple and corny way, (with hilariously bad mic quality).</p><br />
          <p>
            But the most peculiar thing about the Uncle Scary Youtube channel is the amount of videos it has. A channel like this, how many videos do you think it has? 
          </p>
          <p>10? 20? 50? Perhaps 100?</p><br />
          <p>Would you believe me if I said over <b>14,000</b> videos?</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"This is a warning to those who meet up with me, you are going to leave the comfort of the light and set in to the world of the supernatural."</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNXpGKTA8Bs&t=42s">- Uncle Scary my first video 2</a></p>

        <h1>Other Oddities</h1>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>Uncle Scary's channel also includes more strange things. For example, in his saved playlist, 
            he has over 23 different playlists each filled with hundreds of horror movies. All the playlists are organized from favorite to 23rd favorite.<br />
          He is also subscribed to hundreds of other Youtube channels, all somehow related to horror films or media.</p><br />

          <p>While a large amount of the videos on the channel follow the format I talked about before, there are unique videos, such as 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKVCBPosJ48&t=2s">OPERATION WITCHFORCE</a>,
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7uAvAtyNY4">Tor Johnson walking</a>,
            and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mVjHPW5uj4">Scary Skull man</a><br />
          While those videos might mean more, I can't seem to understand them (especially OPERATION WITCHFORCE).</p><br />

        <h1>Another One!</h1>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>Another abnormality about the channel is the reuse of content, both on the "main channel" and "secondary channels" (
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@terrortheatremania2">Uncle Scary "2" </a>, 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@terrortheatremania3">Uncle Scary 3 </a>) </p><br>
